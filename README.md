# ResourceAutoLoader
This is a small plugin that exposes child properties onto the owner node by setting up resources.

### Use case
Let's say you have an `Enemy` class that may include several nodes such as `EnemyHealthComponent` or `EnemyAttackComponent`. You'd like to expose those components' properties in the owner node so you can tweak those values for each instance, but here are your current options:
- Create proxy variables in the owner node that will be passed onto the children by writing specific code for each one of those variables.
- Create a resource system that, again, will need specific code for each child.
- Set the children as editable in the inspector and search through all of them to change their values.

#### But what if you could actually expose children properties without having to code anything?
That's what this plugin is for! With minimal implementation, you can edit children properties within the owner node, as if it was just another property from that node. The plugin has the following features:

üîç Choose which properties will be exposed so you don't have to worry about bloating the inspector with things that you don't need.<br>
üß© Add or remove nodes in the scene freely, the inspector will expose the properties that are relevant for the given combination of components.<br>
‚ú® Changes are applied immediately in the inspector, so every property will be up to date when you launch the game.<br>
üö© Support for hints, so you can limit or specify the behaviour of the inspector for each property.

# How to use it
For clarity sake, let's say you have the following structure:
```gdscript
Enemy # This is the owner node, where we want to be able to edit children properties
‚îî HealthComponent # This is the child node that we'll be focusing on for the example
‚îî AttackComponent
‚îî ...
```
### 1. Create a Resource
- Use the `@export` annotation to make the properties visible for the plugin.
- You can use `@export_range` for floats and integers.
- You can create nested classes for keeping things organized.

```gdscript
class_name EnemyResource extends Resource

  class EnemyHealthResource extends EnemyResource:
    @export_range(1,1000,1) var max_health : int
```

### 2. Declare the properties and the resource type in the child node
- Declare a variable named `resource_type` in the child node that holds a reference to the Resource you just created.
- Declare the different properties you want to import from the resource. Note that the names must be exactly the same.
- You can also import properties that are already present in the base class, such as `position` for a `Node2D`, for example.

```gdscript
class_name EnemyHealthComponent extends Node

  @export_range(1,1000,1) var max_health : int

  var resource_type := EnemyResource.EnemyHealthResource
```

### 3. Modify the child properties from the owner node
- Now you can see the exported properties in the owner node and modify them without having to search each individual node in the scene tree.

# FAQ
#### Can I name the `resource_type` variable differently?
Yes, in the plugin files you can edit `resource_auto_loader.gd` and change the value of the constant named `RESOURCE_TYPE_NAME`.
#### What are the supported types of properties?
So far you can work with _booleans_, _integers_, _floats_, _strings_, _Vector2_, _Vector3_ and resource paths. I've been trying to allow node paths and other complex types but it seems that there's not an easy way to replicate Godot's UI for that kind of behaviour.
#### What are the supported hints?
For now, only `@export_range` is supported. There aren't many other useful hints for the type of properties currently supported. If I see there's something else that could be interesting I will add it.
